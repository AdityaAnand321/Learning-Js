js modules are a way to structure and organize code
to use one file in another you need to export and import 

Types of FileExports in Js: 
1.default exports: it is used only once
        function hello();
        export default hello;
        or export default function hello();

2.named exports: share multiple models thru it
                no need to use word default;
                eg: export hello, export{hello,name}


:: rename bhi kar sakte hai exports: export {sayHello as greet}

Types of FileImports in Js: 
1.import getAlluser from "getuser.js"
2.import {name} from "username.js"
3. import {name, sayHello} from 'user.js'
4. rename imports: import {userName as name, greet as sayHello} from 'user.js'
5. import entire module import * from "user.js"

here is how to use it 
user.name: 
user.functionname;
